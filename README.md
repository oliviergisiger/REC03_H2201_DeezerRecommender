# Recommender Systems Course Project

This repository contains all code that was developed as part of the course project. 
All code should be executable, the packaging system is pipenv. A Pipfile/Pifile.lock
is included in this repository to easy install all relevant Python packages used in this project. 

The Dataset, containing more than 7 million records is not hosted on github. 
In order to run the code, train and test csv must be saved in /data directory. 

As the project strongly relies on TensorFlow-Recommenders, please consider its [documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/recommenders)


The final project report is submitted directly to ilias. 
The report in the submission folder is listed for completeness but does not include reflexions.
